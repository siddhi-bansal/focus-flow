# FocusPulse — Short, user-friendly roadmap

This file lists high-level improvements and features for FocusPulse. They're written in plain language so it's easy to pick things up or share with others.

1. Make app categories not hard coded
   - use GPT to determine what the app category should be

2. Add a section for specifically how you spend your time when AI agents (like maybe VS Code or ChatGPT are running) - I really like this!

3. Chrome tab tracking
   - Why: Chrome is often used for both work and distraction—tab-level data helps separate the two.

4. Add more useful charts and metrics
   - Examples: session length distribution, a heatmap showing what hours you work best, a rolling focus score over time.
   - Why: these give clearer, actionable insights about your habits.

5. Reset or archive data every day
   - Automatically start a fresh log each day and keep an archive of past days, so daily summaries are simple.
   - Why: keeps data tidy and makes daily reporting easier.

6. Easy export and privacy controls
   - Add buttons to export selected date ranges, delete data, or opt out of tracking.
   - Why: gives control over your data and makes sharing/exporting simple.

7. Make the tracker run quietly in the background (macOS)
   - Provide an easy way to run the tracker automatically when you log in (optional to enable).
   - Why: removes friction so tracking can be continuous without manual starts.
